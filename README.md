#Linux LIRC GPIO Driver for AT91SAM9G25

lirc_sam - Device driver that records pulse- and pause-lengths
(space-lengths) (just like the lirc_serial driver does)
between GPIO interrupt events on the AT91SAM9G25.
Lots of code has been taken from the lirc_serial module
and the lirc_rpi module,
so I would like say thanks to the authors.
